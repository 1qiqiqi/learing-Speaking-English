Scientists suggest that today,most adults get up to two hour's less sleep than 
they need .As a result,those lacking in sleep is forgetful,tired,and less productive and grumpy.
Sleep is the time when our bodies and minds are rested and restored.

there are two types of sleep:Rapid Eye Movement and No-REM,
we need both types of sleep to be healthy.
The Rapid Eye Movement is when we dream.our mind is active,and our eye have
fast short movements,as if watching something.this type of sleep helps restore our mind

Non-REM sleep is when our brain and body slow down,our heart rate slows and breathing is regular.
this type of sleep helps restore our body.we have twice as much No-REM sleep as REM sleep each night.
To get better sleep,have a regular time for sleeping and a routine before you go to bed.

this will give your body the signal that it is time to sleep.Make sure that your bed and bedrooom 
are quiet and comforable.if your bed are too hard or too soft.if you are cold or hot,you will not sleep well.
for two hours before going to bed do not drink coffee and alcohol ,or do not smoke and exercise.
All these activities stimulate your body and make sleep difficult.
