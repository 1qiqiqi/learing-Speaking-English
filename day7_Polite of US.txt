These days,The American present is one of the most powful men in the world.
he can make war,or peace,he can touch the lives of millions in many different countries.
but the present can't do just what he wants,the Congress must agree first.

in some ways,the united states is like fifty small countries and not one large one.
Every state has its own goveror,has its own police,and its own laws.
for example,in some states you can buy a alcololic drink when you are 18.
in others,you must wait until you are 21;

the governoment of whole country("the fedral governoment") works from HUSHENGDUN,the capital city.
this is where Congress is based.
the Congress has two parts,it is the senator and the house of Representativity.

there are 100 members of the senator,two from each state.
the present cannot act without the senator's agreement.
the house of Representativity has 345 members.like the senator,they can make new laws.

the Americans choose a new present every four years.the selection is a great occasion.it's a serious business.of course .the 
Americans make sure that it is fun too.
