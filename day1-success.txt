Success means different for different people ,some equat it with fame,some with wealth ,some with accomplishment;

for me ,it means fulfilling one's dream,whatever your dream are,you have a goal here and then focus all your attention on it;

Dreams bring you hope and happiness,the precess of struggling for it,you cry,sweat,complain and even cursor,
but the joy of harvesting makes you fogget all the pains and troubles that you have gone through;
so an old preverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal;

there is serval keys to success,First ,your goal must be pratical and praticable.
if you set your goal too high,the chances are that you will never attain it;
Next,you must make a plan of doing it,you can take some of steps to realize it.since the precess is quite tough,you need to be dilegenr,patient,preservering

even if you meet with some difficulties and frustrations,you take it in your stride,you can always tell yourself you there is nothing insurmountable.
with the will and determination,the success is wait for you in the end of the tunnel.
